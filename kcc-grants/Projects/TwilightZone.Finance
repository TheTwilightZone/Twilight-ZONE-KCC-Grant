## üéØProject Overview

          - Overview: Decentralized Reserve Currency Protocol

          - Project Details: Twilight ZONE is the first decentralized reserve currency protocol being developed exclusively by Alpha DAO on the KCC network based on the ZONE token. Each ZONE token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., DAI, ZONE-DAI LP Tokens, and etc.) in the Twilight ZONE treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Twilight ZONE also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting.
