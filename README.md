## What is Twilight ZONE?
Twilight ZONE is the first decentralized reserve currency protocol being developed exclusively by Alpha DAO on the KCC network based on the ZONE token. Each ZONE token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., DAI, ZONE-DAI LP Tokens, and etc.) in the Twilight ZONE treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Twilight ZONE also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting.

## What is the point of Twilight ZONE?
Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, native to KCC, in which the behavior of the ZONE token is controlled at a high level. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that ZONE can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.
